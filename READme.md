# AI-Powered Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for IoT Security

## Overview
The **AI-Powered Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for IoT Security** is a machine learning-based security solution designed to detect anomalies and potential intrusions in IoT networks. This project leverages artificial intelligence to analyze network traffic and identify security threats in real-time.

## Features
- **AI-Driven Intrusion Detection**: Uses deep learning models to classify network traffic as normal or malicious.
- **Network Traffic Analysis**: Monitors IoT network activity for potential threats.
- **Flask Web Interface**: Provides an interactive UI for visualization and monitoring.
- **Automated Alerts**: Sends notifications when suspicious activity is detected.

## Repository Structure

### Core Scripts
- **`AWS_IoT_Defender.py`** – Security module for AWS IoT devices.
- **`Azura_IoT_Security.py`** – Security module for Microsoft Azure IoT environments.
- **`iot_ids.py`** – The main intrusion detection script.
- **`iot_ids_combined.py`** – A combined version of the IDS system.
- **`iot_intrusion_model.h5`** – Pretrained deep learning model for intrusion detection.

### Web Interface
- **`index.html`** – Main frontend dashboard.
- **`index_combined.html`** – An alternative UI version.

### Documentation
- **`README.md`** – Documentation file (this document).

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- **Python 3.x**
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (`pip install tensorflow`)
- **Flask** (`pip install flask`)
- **Scapy** (`pip install scapy`)
- **Requests** (`pip install requests`)
- **Numpy & Pandas** (`pip install numpy pandas`)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hipster2110/AI-PoweredIntrusionDetectionSystem-IDS-forIoTSecurity.git
   cd AI-PoweredIntrusionDetectionSystem-IDS-forIoTSecurity
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Flask server:
   ```bash
   python iot_ids.py
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the web interface in your browser:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```
2. Start network monitoring.
3. View detected threats and risk levels.

## Future Enhancements
- **Integration with cloud platforms** (AWS, Azure, GCP).
- **Real-time threat visualization**.
- **Enhanced deep learning models for higher accuracy**.
