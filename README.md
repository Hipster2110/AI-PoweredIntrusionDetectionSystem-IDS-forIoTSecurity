# AI-Powered Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for IoT Security

## Overview
The **AI-Powered IDS for IoT Security** is a machine learning-based system designed to detect intrusions and anomalies in IoT networks. This project leverages advanced AI models to enhance network security and protect IoT devices from cyber threats.

## Features
- **Intrusion Detection**: Identifies malicious network traffic.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Utilizes trained AI models for real-time analysis.
- **Dataset Handling**: Supports feature extraction and preprocessing.
- **Flask Web Interface**: Provides a user-friendly dashboard.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Analyzes network traffic dynamically.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.x
- Flask (`pip install flask`)
- NumPy (`pip install numpy`)
- Pandas (`pip install pandas`)
- Scikit-learn (`pip install scikit-learn`)
- TensorFlow/Keras (`pip install tensorflow`)
- Matplotlib (`pip install matplotlib`)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hipster2110/AI-PoweredIntrusionDetectionSystem-IDS-forIoTSecurity.git
   cd AI-PoweredIntrusionDetectionSystem-IDS-forIoTSecurity
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Flask server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the web interface in your browser:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```
2. Upload network traffic logs for analysis.
3. View real-time intrusion detection results.

## Example Output
```json
{
    "timestamp": "2025-03-07 14:30:00",
    "source_ip": "192.168.1.10",
    "destination_ip": "192.168.1.20",
    "protocol": "TCP",
    "intrusion_detected": true,
    "attack_type": "DDoS"
}
```

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with cloud-based security solutions.
- Advanced deep learning models for improved detection.
- Automated response mechanisms for detected threats.
